    <h1> Speed Pool </h1>
    <br><br><br><br>

    <t> Welcome to Speed Pool almost exactly like regular Pool except the color or pattern has no importance only the time it takes you to pot all the balls</t>
    <t> Key differences are: If you POT the CueBall you LOSE immediately Game Over and have to fully restart </t>
    <t> If the cue ball is stationary you can still hit it before waiting for all the balls to become stationary rewarding accurate play</t>
    <br><br>
    <img src="Table.png" alt="Pool Table Picture" style="width:800px;height:400px;">
    <br><br>
    <t> To send the cue ball you click anywhere within the area of the given image; Marked by the X in the image</t>
    <t> The ball will go in that direction in which you clicked with a certain velocity; Marked by the arrow</t>
    <t> Finally the speed of the ball is measured by how far away you clicked from the cue ball</t>
    <t>The greater the distance away the greater the speed</t>
    <br><br>
    <t> Good Luck and Have fun </t>
